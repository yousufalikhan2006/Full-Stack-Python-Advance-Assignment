    "#### An abstract superclass is the class that calls a method, but does not inherit or define it. It expects the method to be filled in by a subclass. This is often used as a way to generalize classes when behavior cann't be predicted until a more specific subclass is coded. OOP frameworks also use this as a way to dispatch to client-defined, customizable operations."
